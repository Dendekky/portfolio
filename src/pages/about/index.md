##### HI THERE!

My name is Ibrahim Adeniyi. An experienced Software developer.

I love interacting with anything and everything code. I guess you could call me the Code Whisperer.

Building a career in tech was born out of my passion for creating solutions to seemingly complex problems and finding smart shortcuts to cracking complicated puzzles. The feeling that comes with exclaiming “Eureka!” gives me unexplainable satisfaction.

I am a Fullstack developer meaning, I’ve got my clients covered with wonderful servers. 



###### CAREER

Presently, I work remotely as a Software Engineer with an Edtech startup headquartered in Moscow; Conectar LLC.

In my time here, I have perfected the platform’s whiteboard tool to handle functionalities like file upload, sticky notes, text, shapes etc. while transmitting actions across to other users using websocket. I have also worked on the authentication system amongst other features.

Prior to Conectar, I worked both full-time & on contract basis with about 5 startups, the most recent role being a Frontend Developer at Foodlocker Ltd, a Nigerian Agribusiness startup. 
I also helped to found Piocode; a peer-to-peer learning community of students.

In my work, I develop web applications from design and implementation to testing and development. I ensure written code meet industry standards by ensuring proper practices like version control and documentation.

LANGUAGES

By the way, below are some of the stacks I work with consistently:

* NodeJS (Express)
* React
* Gatsby
* MongoDB
* PostgreSQL

TOOLS

These are some of my favourite tools for serving software solutions;

* Netlify & Heroku - I use these to deploy applications.
* ESLint & Prettier - Use these for formatting and setting...
* Cloudinary - My go-to for serving & storing optimized images.
* CircleCI - For testing software

You can check my resume for full details on the Technologies that I work best with. Also, check out my profiles on [github ](https://github.com/dendekky)and [linkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dendekky).

HOBBIES

Asides spreading the Gospel of Science, I enjoy football, playing video games and sending dark memes to unsuspecting victims. I also enjoy cracking coding challenges with my best pals.

On a regular day, you’d find me working at my laptop - building new programs or reading.

I am a proud Man-U fan and have successfully recovered from the Reddit bug.

I’d have loved to add that I enjoy fishing trips, surfing and weekend camping with my pals but those are plans that are still in the works.

Generally, I am a simple man who strives for excellence in all I do.
